If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex tablets is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4-to 5hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex tablets are given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, keep the dosage to a minimum.

Bumetanide is a potent diuretic (water pill) that causes a profound increase in urine output (diuresis) by preventing the kidney from retaining fluid. Specifically, it blocks the reabsorption of sodium and fluid from the kidney's tubules.
